### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Quick note to anyone who manage to wander into my profile. Whatever you see me posting to my public GitHub, itâ€™s almost certain something I'm toying with. And maybe it works, and maybe it doesnâ€™t work. If I'm tasked with doing something production ready, thatâ€™s rock solid and thorougly tested, it's not going to any public repo.

I guess thats a lot of words trying to say that you shouldn't really use any code you find here, in your production envioronment ðŸ˜„
